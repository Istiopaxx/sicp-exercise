; Each of the following two procedures converts a binary tree to a list.


(define (tree->list-1 tree)
  (if (null? tree)

      (append (tree->list-1 (left-branch tree))
              (cons (entry tree)
                    (tree->list-1 (right-branch tree))))))

    (if (null? tree)
        result-list
        (copy-to-list (left-branch tree)
                      (cons (entry tree)
                            (copy-to-list (right-branch tree)
                                          result-list)))))

; a. Do the two procedures produce the same result for every tree? If not, how do the results differ?
;    What lists do the two procedures produce for the trees in figure 2.16?

; It looks all same.. above two procedures are functionally identical: their implementation is not.
; First is recursive, Second is iterative form.



; ==================================================
; b. Do the two procedures have the same order of growth in the number of steps required to convert
;    a balanced tree with n elements to a list? If not, which one grows more slowly?

; ====================
; 1. tree->list-1 procedure
; T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + O(n/2)
;                      â””> because of append operation which takes linear time.
; => T(n) = O(nlogn)

; ====================
; 2. tree->list-2 procedure
; T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + O(1)

; => T(n) = O(n)
